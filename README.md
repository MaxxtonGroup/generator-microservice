> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Install and run the generator

1. checkout this repository
2. open a console (cmd, bash, terminal, etc)
3. call:
```bash
npm link
```
4. create a directory for your new project
5. go to that directory in your console
6. initiate Yeoman:
```bash
yo microservice
```
7. answer all the questions
8. start coding with your new microservice
