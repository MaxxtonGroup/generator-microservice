# Default configuration
# This holds the base configuration and loads by default.
# When setting a spring profile on the commandline you can override parts of this config.
# Please note that the default config links development as it's default active profile (so this also loads when not setting a param).
spring:
  application:
    name: <%= baseName %>
  profiles:
    active: development

# Development config
# This configuration is set as the active profile in the default config.
# Additional profiles can be chained by using a comma in the commandline parameter.
# For example: -spring.profiles.active: developement,peer1 or -spring.profiles.active: developement,peer2
